--- re-building ‘mlrMBO.Rmd’ using rmarkdown
** Processing: /var/scratch2/tomas/cran/rcnst/check/mlrMBO.Rcheck/vign_test/mlrMBO/vignettes/mlrMBO_files/figure-html/cosine_fun-1.png
1344x960 pixels, 8 bits/pixel, 256 colors in palette
Reducing image to 8 bits/pixel, grayscale
Input IDAT size = 28819 bytes
Input file size = 29713 bytes

Trying:
  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 0  f = 0		IDAT size = 23816
  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 1  f = 0		IDAT size = 23525
  zc = 1  zm = 8  zs = 2  f = 0  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 3  f = 0  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 0  f = 5		IDAT size = 22820
  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 1  f = 5		IDAT size = 22557
  zc = 1  zm = 8  zs = 2  f = 5  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 3  f = 5                               
Selecting parameters:
  zc = 9  zm = 8  zs = 1  f = 5		IDAT size = 22557

Output IDAT size = 22557 bytes (6262 bytes decrease)
Output file size = 22635 bytes (7078 bytes = 23.82% decrease)
